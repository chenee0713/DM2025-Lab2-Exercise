      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

      "\n",
      "\t Definition \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, ML algorithms use statistical techniques to enable systems to 'learn' from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions without human intervention. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Types of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Common types include supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error with rewards and penalties). \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Applications \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t ML is used in a wide range of applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis. \n",

      "Data Centers \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Definition \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t A data center is a dedicated physical facility that an organization uses to house its critical IT infrastructure, including servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and related components. These facilities are designed to provide a secure, reliable, and controlled environment for computing operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Key Components \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Essential components include servers, storage devices, network switches and routers, power supplies (including UPS and generators), cooling systems (HVAC), and physical security measures. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Purpose \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Data centers serve as the central hub for data storage, processing, and management, enabling businesses to run applications, host websites, and manage their digital operations. \n",

      "Large Language Models (LLMs) \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Definition \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs are characterized by their enormous size (billions or trillions of parameters) and their ability to perform a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Capabilities \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs can perform tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, code generation, and creative writing. They learn complex linguistic patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities from their training data. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Underlying Technology \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are typically built using deep learning architectures, most notably the Transformer architecture, which allows them to process sequential data like text very effectively. \n",

      "\n",
      "\t LLMs as a Product of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are a sophisticated application and outcome of machine learning research and development. The techniques used to train LLMs, such as deep learning and neural networks, are core machine learning concepts. Therefore, LLMs are a specific, advanced type of machine learning model. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Data Centers as the Foundation for LLMs and ML \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Training and running LLMs, as well as many other complex machine learning models, requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data storage. Data centers provide the necessary infrastructure – high-performance servers, specialized hardware (like GPUs and TPUs), robust networking, and reliable power – to handle these computationally intensive tasks. Without data centers, it would be practically impossible to develop, train, and deploy LLMs at scale. \n",

      "\t Interdependence \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t In essence, machine learning is the field of study and the set of techniques. LLMs are a powerful manifestation of these techniques. Data centers are the physical environments and infrastructure that enable the training, deployment, and operation of both general machine learning models and highly demanding LLMs. LLMs rely on ML principles, and both ML and LLMs rely heavily on the resources provided by data centers. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "**Dataset:** Inception (2010) - Roger Ebert Review (3 pages, 5204 chars)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extraction Results:**\n",
    "- Total entities: 46\n",
    "  - opinion_statement: 31 (67.4%)\n",
    "  - audience_impact: 15 (32.6%)\n",
    "- Sentiment distribution: Positive (23), Negative (8), Mixed (0)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grounding Quality**\n",
    "   - All extractions mapped to exact character positions\n",
    "   - Verbatim extraction enforced (no paraphrasing)\n",
    "   - Zero hallucinations detected\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extraction Examples**\n",
    "   - Positive: \"wholly original, cut from new cloth\" (subject: Inception)\n",
    "   - Negative: \"too literal-minded, too caught up in ticktock logistics\" (subject: Nolan's direction)\n",
    "   - Impact: \"I felt out of line even cracking a smile\" (emotion: discomfort, cause: solemn tone)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Performance**\n",
    "   - Successfully identified complex mixed-sentiment statements\n",
    "   - Correctly classified sarcasm/irony (\"I felt out of line...\")\n",
    "   - Captured reviewer's meta-commentary on filmmaking\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Improvements (from langextract docs):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increase recall:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "   extraction_passes=3  # Currently 1\n",
    "   temperature=0.7      # Enable diversity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improve precision:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "   max_char_buffer=1000  # Currently 2000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use stronger model:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "   model_id=\"gemini-2.5-pro\"  # Currently flash-lite\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add custom extraction classes:**\n",
    "   - rating_score (for star ratings)\n",
    "   - comparison (for film comparisons)\n",
    "   - technical_aspect (for cinematography/effects)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issues Identified:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rating score \"4/4 stars\" not extracted (no schema support)\n",
    "2. Some implicit opinions may be missed (require inference)\n",
    "3. Complex compound sentences split into multiple extractions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison with Example (Interstellar):**\n",
    "- Same prompt/examples used\n",
    "- Similar extraction quality\n",
    "- Inception: more abstract/philosophical content\n",
    "- Both demonstrate langextract's domain adaptability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "langextract performs well on movie reviews with precise grounding and minimal hallucination. Primary limitation is schema-defined extraction scope. Recommended for applications requiring high verifiability."

    "   - Silhouette score increased from -0.0954 to -0.0264 (72% improvement toward 0)\n",
    "   - Negative scores indicate overlapping clusters in both projections\n",
    "   - 3D provides marginal but consistent improvement across all emotions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cluster Compactness**\n",
    "   - All emotions show reduced intra-cluster distance in 3D\n",
    "   - Largest improvement: joy (-28.7%), anger (-30.1%), sadness (-26.6%)\n",
    "   - Smallest improvement: fear (-7.1%)\n",
    "   - Tighter clusters indicate better-defined emotion boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visual Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **2D Observations:**\n",
    "   - Significant overlap in central region (UMAP1: 7-9, UMAP2: 1-4)\n",
    "   - Fear and sadness clusters heavily intermixed\n",
    "   - Joy shows partial separation in upper region\n",
    "   - No clear linear boundaries between emotions\n",
    "\n",
    "   **3D Observations:**\n",
    "   - Additional UMAP3 axis provides vertical separation\n",
    "   - Joy cluster more distinct in 3D space (right-upper-back region)\n",
    "   - Fear concentration in lower-front region\n",
    "   - Anger/sadness still show overlap but reduced compared to 2D\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Information Preservation**\n",
    "   - 3D retains more variance from original 3072D embeddings\n",
    "   - Additional dimension captures semantic nuances lost in 2D projection\n",
    "   - Trade-off: visualization complexity vs information fidelity\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Both projections:**\n",
    "   - Negative silhouette scores indicate fundamental overlap in semantic space\n",
    "   - Emotions share common linguistic patterns (e.g., \"upset\" → anger/sadness)\n",
    "   - UMAP cannot fully separate inherently ambiguous text\n",
    "\n",
    "   **3D-specific:**\n",
    "   - Requires interactive rotation for full interpretation\n",
    "   - Point occlusion from certain viewing angles\n",
    "   - Harder to present in static reports\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Practical Implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Use 2D when:**\n",
    "   - Quick exploratory analysis needed\n",
    "   - Creating publication figures\n",
    "   - Cluster separation already adequate\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Use 3D when:**\n",
    "   - 2D shows significant overlap\n",
    "   - Need better feature engineering insights\n",
    "   - Building interactive dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "3D UMAP provides 72% improvement in silhouette score and 7-30% reduction in intra-cluster distances. However, persistent negative scores indicate semantic overlap is not fully resolvable by dimensionality reduction alone. For this emotion classification task, 3D offers marginal gains at the cost of visualization complexity. Better separation likely requires:\n",
    "- Feature engineering (e.g., emotion-specific embeddings)\n",
    "- Supervised dimensionality reduction (e.g., LDA)\n",
    "- Non-linear classifiers tolerant of overlap"

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot learning provides 22.86% accuracy improvement, with most gains from a single example per class. The plateau effect (1→5 shot: +2.38%) indicates that additional examples offer minimal benefit for this task. Joy's consistent high performance and fear's instability suggest that classification difficulty is driven by semantic similarity rather than sample size. The fear degradation in 5-shot points to potential example selection issues or model overconfidence on noisy patterns."

    "**Case Study:** Check the results' files inside the `results/llm_classification_results` directory and find cases where the **text classification improves with more examples** (pred emotion is right with examples), **cases where it does not improve** (pred emotion always wrong) and **cases where the classification got worse with more examples** (pred emotion goes from right to wrong with examples). For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "1. **fear → anger (13.8%):**\n",

    "   - Root cause: Arousal-based similarity (both high-arousal, negative valence)\n",

    "2. **sadness → anger (7.5%):**\n",
    "   - Stable across methods\n",
    "   - Cause: Frustration expressions straddle both emotions\n",

    "\n",
    "Few-shot learning improves 13.8% of cases by disambiguating sarcasm and context-dependent emotions, primarily for anger→joy confusions. However, 40% of samples remain consistently misclassified, suggesting either annotation errors or inherent ambiguity in short social media texts. The persistent fear→anger confusion (13.8%) indicates semantic overlap that examples cannot resolve. Degradation in 3.8% of cases shows example selection matters, but the low rate suggests robustness. For production systems, focus should shift from example quantity to:\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
