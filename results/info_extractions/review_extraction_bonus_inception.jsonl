his screenplay for \"Inception.\" \nThat must have involved prodigious concentration, like playing blindfold chess while \nwalking a tight-wire. The film's hero tests a young architect by challenging her to \ncreate a maze, and Nolan tests us with his own dazzling maze. We have to trust him \nthat he can lead us through, because much of the time we're lost and disoriented. \n \nThe movies often seem to come from the recycling bin these days: Sequels, remakes, \nfranchises. \"Inception\" does a difficult thing. It is wholly original, cut from new cloth, \nand yet structured with action movie basics so it feels like it makes more sense than \n(quite possibly) it does. Christopher Nolan reinvented \"Batman.\" This time he isn't \nreinventing anything. Yet few directors will attempt to recycle \"Inception.\" I think \nwhen Nolan left the labyrinth, he threw away the map. \n \nLike the hero of that film, the viewer of \"Inception\" is adrift in time and experience. \nWe can never even be quite sure what the relationship between dream time and real \ntime is. The hero explains that you can never remember the beginning of a dream, and \nthat dreams that seem to cover hours may only last a short time. Yes, but you don't \nknow that when you're dreaming. And what if you're inside another man's dream? \nHow does your dream time synch with his? \n \nThis is a movie immune to spoilers: If you knew how it ended, that would tell you \nnothing unless you knew how it got there. And telling you how it got there would \nproduce bafflement. The movie is all about process, about fighting our way through \nenveloping sheets of reality and dream, reality within dreams, dreams without reality. \n \nThe film is a perplexing labyrinth without a simple through-line, and is sure to inspire \ntruly endless analysis on the web. Nolan must have rewritten this story time and\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nagain, finding that every change had a ripple effect down through the whole fabric. \nDreams have a shifting architecture, as we all know; where we seem to be has a way \nof shifting. \n \nLeonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a corporate raider of the highest order. He \ninfiltrates the minds of other men to steal their ideas. Now he is hired by a powerful \nbillionaire to do the opposite: To introduce an idea into a rival's mind, and do it so \nwell he believes it is his own. This has never been done before; our minds are as alert \nto foreign ideas as our immune system is to pathogens. \n \nThe film is breathtaking in its visual imagination. The city of Paris literally rolls back \non itself like a roll of linoleum tile while Cobb teaches Ariadne about dream world-\nbuilding. So skilled is Nolan that he actually got me involved in one of his chases, \nwhen I thought I was relatively immune to scenes that have become so standard. \nThat's because I cared about who was chasing and being chased, and understood why, \nand it helped that the movie's very fabric depends on this chase sequence. \n \nThe Matrix, Dark City, and other films have explored similar territory, but Inception \nstands apart. It lacks the nimbleness of Spielberg's Minority Report perhaps, and the \ntone is solemn - I felt out of line even cracking a smile. But that's intentional. Nolan is \ntoo literal-minded, too caught up in ticktock logistics, to make a great, untethered \ndream movie - and that's his choice, his aesthetic. \n \nThe performances are uniformly strong. DiCaprio brings emotional weight to Cobb's \ntortured psyche. Tom Hardy is a standout as Eames, bringing charm and wit. Marion \nCotillard is haunting as Mal, the manifestation of Cobb's guilt and grief. Ellen Page \n(now Elliot Page) provides the audience surrogate as Ariadne, learning the rules as we \ndo.\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 3**\n\"\"\"\nThe film's effects are brontosaurean, like the city that folds over on top of itself. Yet \nthey never overwhelm the story. Nolan uses them to serve his narrative purposes, not \nas ends in themselves. The zero-gravity hotel fight sequence is both technically \nimpressive and emotionally grounded in the story's logic. \n \nWhat makes Inception fascinating is its multi-layered approach. On one level, it's a \nheist thriller. On another, it's a meditation on grief and guilt. On yet another, it's a \nreflexive commentary on filmmaking itself - with Cobb as director, Eames as actor, \nAriadne as production designer. \n \nThe film challenges viewers to sift through multiple layers of unreality. It's a \nfiendishly intricate yarn set in the labyrinth of the subconscious. Some will find it too \ncold, too cerebral. Others will marvel at its ambition and execution. I fall into the \nlatter camp. \n \n\"Inception\" is not without its problems. The rules seem arbitrary at times. Why this, \nwhy not that? But I was willing to accept Nolan's internal logic because the journey \nwas so compelling. And that ending - that marvelous, ambiguous ending - ensures the \nfilm will be debated for years to come. \n \nThis is filmmaking of the highest order. Ambitious, complex, entertaining. Nolan has \ncreated a maze worth getting lost in. \n \nRating: ★★★★ (4 out of 4 stars)\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_d87e4f44"}
