Inception (2010) - Movie Review by Roger Ebert 

It&#x27;s said that Christopher Nolan spent ten years writing his screenplay for &quot;Inception.&quot; 
That must have involved prodigious concentration, like playing blindfold chess while 
walking a tight-wire. The film&#x27;s hero tests a young architect by challenging her to 
create a maze, and Nolan tests us with his own <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">dazzling maze</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">We have to trust him 
that he can lead us through, because much of the time we&#x27;re lost and disoriented.</span> 

The movies often seem to come from the recycling bin these days: Sequels, remakes, 
franchises. &quot;Inception&quot; does a difficult thing. It is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">wholly original, cut from new cloth</span>, 
and yet structured with action movie basics so it feels like it makes more sense than 
(quite possibly) it does. Christopher Nolan reinvented &quot;Batman.&quot; This time he isn&#x27;t 
reinventing anything. Yet few directors will attempt to recycle &quot;Inception.&quot; I think 
when Nolan left the labyrinth, he threw away the map. 

Like the hero of that film, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the viewer of &quot;Inception&quot; is adrift in time and experience.</span> 
We can never even be quite sure what the relationship between dream time and real 
time is. The hero explains that you can never remember the beginning of a dream, and 
that dreams that seem to cover hours may only last a short time. Yes, but you don&#x27;t 
know that when you&#x27;re dreaming. And what if you&#x27;re inside another man&#x27;s dream? 
How does your dream time synch with his? 

This is a movie immune to spoilers: If you knew how it ended, that would tell you 
nothing unless you knew how it got there. And telling you how it got there would 
produce bafflement. The movie is all about process, about fighting our way through 
enveloping sheets of reality and dream, reality within dreams, dreams without reality. 

The film is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a perplexing labyrinth without a simple through-line</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">is sure to inspire 
truly endless analysis on the web.</span> Nolan must have rewritten this story time and
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
again, finding that every change had a ripple effect down through the whole fabric. 
Dreams have a shifting architecture, as we all know; where we seem to be has a way 
of shifting. 

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a corporate raider of the highest order. He 
infiltrates the minds of other men to steal their ideas. Now he is hired by a powerful 
billionaire to do the opposite: To introduce an idea into a rival&#x27;s mind, and do it so 
well he believes it is his own. This has never been done before; our minds are as alert 
to foreign ideas as our immune system is to pathogens. 

The film is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">breathtaking in its visual imagination</span>. The city of Paris literally rolls back 
on itself like a roll of linoleum tile while Cobb teaches Ariadne about dream world-
building. So skilled is Nolan that he actually <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">got me involved in one of his chases</span>, 
when <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I thought I was relatively immune to scenes that have become so standard</span>. 
That&#x27;s because <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I cared about who was chasing and being chased, and understood why</span>, 
and it helped that the movie&#x27;s very fabric depends on this chase sequence. 

The Matrix, Dark City, and other films have explored similar territory, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Inception 
stands apart</span>. It <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">lacks the nimbleness of Spielberg&#x27;s Minority Report</span> perhaps, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the 
tone is solemn</span> - <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I felt out of line even cracking a smile</span>. But that&#x27;s intentional. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Nolan is 
too literal-minded, too caught up in ticktock logistics, to make a great, untethered 
dream movie</span> - and that&#x27;s his choice, his aesthetic. 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The performances are uniformly strong</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">DiCaprio brings emotional weight to Cobb&#x27;s 
tortured psyche</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Tom Hardy is a standout as Eames, bringing charm and wit</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Marion 
Cotillard is haunting as Mal</span>, the manifestation of Cobb&#x27;s guilt and grief. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ellen Page</span> 
(now Elliot Page) provides the audience surrogate as Ariadne, learning the rules as we 
do.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 3**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The film&#x27;s effects are brontosaurean</span>, like the city that folds over on top of itself. Yet 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">they never overwhelm the story</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Nolan uses them to serve his narrative purposes, not 
as ends in themselves</span>. The zero-gravity hotel fight sequence is both <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">technically 
impressive and emotionally grounded in the story&#x27;s logic</span>. 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">What makes Inception fascinating is its multi-layered approach</span>. On one level, it&#x27;s a 
heist thriller. On another, it&#x27;s a meditation on grief and guilt. On yet another, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it&#x27;s a 
reflexive commentary on filmmaking itself</span> - with Cobb as director, Eames as actor, 
Ariadne as production designer. 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The film <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">challenges viewers to sift through multiple layers of unreality</span></span>. It&#x27;s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a 
fiendishly intricate yarn</span> set in the labyrinth of the subconscious. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Some will find it too 
cold, too cerebral</span></span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Others will marvel at its ambition and execution</span></span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I fall into the 
latter camp</span></span>. 

&quot;Inception&quot; is not without its problems. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The rules seem arbitrary at times</span>. Why <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">this</span>, 
why not that? But <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I was willing to accept Nolan&#x27;s internal logic because <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the journey 
was so compelling</span></span>. And that ending - <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">that marvelous, ambiguous ending</span></span> - <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="41" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">ensures the 
film will be debated for years to come</span>. 

This is filmmaking of the highest order. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="42" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ambitious, complex, entertaining</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="43" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="44" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Nolan has 
created a maze worth getting lost in</span></span>. 

Rating: ★★★★ (4 out of 4 stars)
